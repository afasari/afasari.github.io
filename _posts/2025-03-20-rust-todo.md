Hey fellow developers! 👋 Today, I'm excited to share my journey building a robust Todo API using Rust's powerful ecosystem. This project showcases how to create a production-ready REST API with modern tools and best practices.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust's safety guarantees, performance, and growing ecosystem make it an excellent choice for building reliable web services. Combined with Axum for routing and Diesel for ORM, we get a powerful foundation for our API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Rust
- Axum (Web framework)
- Diesel (ORM)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## ✨ Key Features

- Complete CRUD operations
- RESTful endpoints
- Database integration
- Docker support
- Scalable architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

Setting up the project is straightforward:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd todo

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run migrations
diesel migration run

# Start the server
cargo run
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

```plaintext
POST /tasks   - Create a new task
GET /tasks    - List all tasks
GET /tasks/1  - Get a specific task
POST /tasks/1 - Update a task
DELETE /tasks/1 - Delete a task
```

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern:

- Routes layer (API endpoints)
- Service layer (Business logic)
- Repository layer (Database operations)
- Models (Data structures)

## 💡 Implementation Highlights

Here's a glimpse of how we handle task creation:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct CreateTask {
    title: String,
    description: Option<String>,
}

async fn create_task(
    Json(payload): Json<CreateTask>,
    State(db): State<Pool<Postgres>>,
) -> Result<Json<Task>, StatusCode> {
    // Implementation details
}
```

## 🔄 Future Roadmap

We have exciting plans for the future:

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT implementation
   - Role-based access
   - OAuth2 support

2. Enhanced Task Management
   - Categories/Tags
   - Priority levels
   - Due dates
   - Attachments

3. Infrastructure
   - Docker containerization
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Monitoring with Prometheus
   - Grafana dashboards

4. Security
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Rate limiting

5. Frontend Development
   - React.js client
   - Mobile app with React Native

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

Building this API taught me several valuable lessons:

1. Rust's powerful type system for API design
2. Structured error handling
3. Database integration patterns
4. API security best practices
