## Introduction

It's end of 2025, been more than 6 years since my first professional job, why I want to restart again from the basic? Because It's important and always relevant. Even you are in the senior level, every basic things are being implemented in real case.

## Journey

This article will a long chain journal to learn data structure and algorithm (DSA). It's is part of my journey to restart learning programming (cover in later post). In this first article, I'm using this [roadmap](https://github.com/serverx-org/DSA-MASTERY) <https://github.com/serverx-org/DSA-MASTERY/blob/main/00-dsa-roadmap/dsa-roadmap.png> to learn.

## Programming language

I have 1 years experience in PHP, 5 years experience in Golang and Javascript, and learning some Python and Rust, this journey will use all of them, but mostly in Golang since it's my primary language in current company.

I was learning Golang using [this](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-A6X37910/) and [this](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-XFWVPO56/) Udemy courses, there are a lot of new resources out there, even the free one. For JavaScript, Python and Rust, I'm using Dicoding courses ([JavaScript 1](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/JLX19NQENP72), [JavaScript 2](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/KEXL75630XG2), [JavaScript 3](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/GRX5J96RKX0M), [Python](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/2VX3KQ4EJXYQ), [Rust](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/98XWOQJ7LZM3).

## Nest Step

I will start with data structure in next post
